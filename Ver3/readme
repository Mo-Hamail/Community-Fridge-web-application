Ver. 2  was built using client-side technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
In Ver. 2, we began to build the server-side component of the web application. Specifically, 
we created a Node.js server to serve all the resources associated with the application (e.g., HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, CSS, and JSON). In addition to this, we also added persistence in our application, where 
the changes made by the user are saved to the server. Specifically, we added functionality where users 
could drop-off an item into the community fridge. Dropping off an item adds it to the fridges JSON data 
located on the server.

In Ver 3, we will add additional functionality into our application. To support the additional functionality
, we will build on both the client and the server-side code of our application. We will also build
a REST API for accessing various resources of our application. Through this API, our application will 
support the following functionalities:

[modification] View the list of fridges
[new feature] Add a new fridge
[new feature] Edit the details of a fridge
[new feature] Delete a fridge
[modification] View the list of items in a fridge
[modification] Deleting items from a fridge
[modification] Add an item to the fridge
[modification] Retrieve the list of items in the system
[modification] Create a new item in the system
[new feature] Update an item in the system
