# Community-Fridge-web-application
created a Node.js server to serve all the resources associated with the application (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CSS, and JSON). In addition to this, we also added persistence in our application. In Ver. 3, we further built the assignment in Express, specifically focusing on building a REST API. 

Version 4, we will connect our Express application to a MongoDB database. This involves moving all of the data from our JSON files into the MongoDB database and performing queries on this data.
